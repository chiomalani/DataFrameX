# DataFrameX Project - Phase 1

## Overview
**DataFrameX** is a comprehensive tool designed to guide data scientists through every phase of the data science lifecycle using pre-built, structured prompts. These prompts cover key stages such as:

- Business Understanding
- Data Collection
- Data Preparation
- Modeling
- Evaluation
- Deployment
- Feedback

The notebook provides tailored guidance and code snippets in **Python** and **R**, assisting with tasks like data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation. The current phase includes the pre-built prompts for each phase, offering both detailed explanations and code examples for typical data science operations.

## Current Status
This notebook represents the **first phase** of the DataFrameX project. In this phase, users can explore the notebook and use the provided prompts and code. Future phases will focus on transforming this into a fully interactive web application where users can input their project details and receive personalized feedback and code recommendations.

---

### Goals for the App:
1. **Interactive Web App**: The goal is to build an interactive web application where users can interact with the DataFrameX tool. Users will enter project details (e.g., industry, dataset) and receive tailored data science advice.
2. **Customization**: Enable dynamic responses based on user inputs for specific industries or datasets.
3. **Scalability**: Scale the tool to handle larger datasets and provide real-time project feedback using cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud).

## Next Steps

- **Phase 2**: Develop the backend using Flask to handle prompt execution and responses dynamically.
- **Phase 3**: Build the frontend using HTML/JavaScript or a modern framework like React to enable user interaction.
- **Phase 4**: Deploy the web application on a platform like Heroku or AWS, enabling real-time feedback.
